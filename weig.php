                    <b>PIT TYPE structure model</b> is sustainable and durable for many years without any
                    problems against rainwater drainage system and thrown into a healthy infrastructure.
                    <br><br>Static calculations of <b>PIT TYPE structure model</b> was made according to
                    international loading and measurement standards by Malaysia PE architecture drawing. <b>PIT TYPE</b>
                    construction was designed checking the weight of heaviest axle limits of the vehicles, their
                    position, and movement and braking forces on the truck scales. With these calculations, uniform
                    charge distribution created on it. With <b>PIT TYPE structure</b> and stainless-steel multiple load
                    cells design ensure superior strength and high measurement accuracy.

                    loading to the truck, unloading to the install area and installation process much easier.
                    <br><br><b>PITLESS type weighbridge</b> is the most popular weighbridge among all categories of
                    Weighbridge. Unlike Pit Type Weighbridge, this weighbridge generally installs above the Surface
                    level which require the Ramp on both sides for vehicle to approach to Weighbridge platform. This
                    type of weighbridge requires larger floor space as compared to the Pit type weighbridge due to
                    the requirement of Ramp but is still the economic & most reliable solution. <b>PITLESS
                        weighbridge</b> requires the least Civil Construction cost.
